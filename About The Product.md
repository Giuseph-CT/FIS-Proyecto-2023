<h2 id="about-the-product"><strong>About The Product</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Product evolution</strong></p>
<p>During the first delivery of the project, our product started as software designed to serve as a tool to facilitate the organization and management of calculations for the nutritional requirements of patients in need of a dietary plan. To make this work, the software will handle the precise calculations of the patient’s personal nutritional requirements. Similarly, it will provide a recording and storage system where the user can access and organize files, records, and documents that may be generated, keeping everything at their fingertips in one place.</p>
<p>For the second delivery, the software essentially continued with the same purpose, but now added the functionality of cloud service so that the user can access their documents and files from any internet-connected device.</p>
<p>In the third delivery, the software maintained its objective, as well as the functions that were added throughout this process, eventually being defined as software that holds value in the facilities it provides for the management of files necessary for nutritional care.</p>
<p><strong>Users/clients</strong></p>
<p>The main users for this software are nutrition professionals aiming to provide efficient and comprehensive nutritional care to patients attending consultations. The nutrition professional will need to input specific patient data and information into the software for it to function correctly.</p>
<p><strong>Value Proposition</strong></p>
<p>With the use of this software, the aim is to make the management of files, documents, records, and nutritional data easy, fast, and efficient. The cloud functionality is implemented to ensure that these files and documents, which encompass the patient’s nutritional history, including editable medical records and requirement calculations, are always accessible. Once the user inputs the necessary data, the software will generate a personalized record that is saved in the cloud for access whenever needed, even from another device, simply by logging into their personal account.</p>
