<p>After careful review and evaluation, we have made the decision not to make any further updates to the established requirements. We believe that the current requirements are comprehensive and fully address the system’s needs. Here is an explanation of our decision:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Adequacy of Current Requirements:</strong> We have considered that the currently defined functional requirements comprehensively cover the essential functionalities the system must fulfill. These requirements address key aspects, such as patient registration, accurate calculation of nutritional requirements, nutritional history, and cloud storage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>User Needs Satisfaction:</strong> We believe that the established requirements meet the needs and expectations of users, including nutrition professionals and healthcare staff. Key elements, such as data import from electronic health record systems and the ability to analyze nutritional trends over time, are duly considered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Avoidance of Unnecessary Complexity:</strong> We have refrained from adding unnecessary requirements to avoid introducing superfluous complexities into the system. The clarity and conciseness of the current requirements contribute to a solid understanding of the project’s goals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Satisfaction with Current Outcomes:</strong> We are content with the current outcomes achieved so far. The current requirements provide a solid foundation for system development, and we believe that maintaining stability at this point will enhance the efficiency of the development process.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, we believe that the initially defined functional requirements are adequate and complete, and we see no need for additional adjustments. We are committed to moving forward with implementation based on these requirements and will closely monitor any changes that may arise during the project’s development.</p>
