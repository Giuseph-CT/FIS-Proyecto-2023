<p><strong>Organization</strong>.</p>
<p>Since the first delivery we have been applying an ineffective method of assigning roles and tasks which consisted of a meeting at the beginning of each delivery to make the distribution of work with the whole team, a meeting that only took place once per delivery, therefore, our administration generated that we kept giving equally the tasks, making that everyone received the same amount of these regardless of the weight of that task. On the other hand, we did not apply weekly meetings, but we were talking about the project continuously on Whatsapp where we did not have a proper order and documentation of the tasks completed, pending and in process, because everyone simply notified when they finished their part so that the team leader (Giuseph) could see that it was okay and move forward with what was missing. For this last release we were making changes in our task management process, where we had meetings in the Discord platform usually every three or four times a week to check the changes and be aware of the updates in the repository; also, it worked as a workspace where everyone focused on their assigned tasks and at the same time be in direct contact with the team. To improve this administrative aspect of the repository we were applying elements learned in class with respect to what was seen in class, for example, for the assignment of tasks we assigned scores to each one to make a more effective distribution of effort for each one, numbering from one to three being three the number of assignment for the greatest importance, time and effort; two for important and not so laborious while the number one were the tasks that we could leave for the end and had a very great weight in the project.</p>
