# Correspondence with requirements

## User authentication (login):
Description: Implement a secure login system that requires unique credentials for access. This ensures the privacy and security of patient information.
For user authentication we have created two interfaces from which the nutritionist can log in directly and in the event that they do not have an account, we have created another interface for registration.

## Patient registration:
Description: The system must allow nutrition professionals to register patients, including personal, medical and nutritional information. Additionally, importing patient data from electronic health records (EHR) systems should be allowed to simplify the process.

For patient registration, we have created an interface in which the nutritionist can directly register the patient and save it directly in the cloud, creating a patient file.

You can also upload the data directly from the cloud if some data needs to be modified.

## Calculation of Nutritional Requirements:
Description: The software must be able to accurately calculate each patient's personalized nutritional requirements, taking into account their age, medical conditions and changes in health status over time.
To calculate nutritional requirements, there is the interface in which the nutritional calculator is included, which will calculate according to age, medical conditions according to the patient's record, health changes, etc.

At the bottom the results will be shown and if the goal proposed by the nutritionist is reached.

## Nutritional history:
Description: There should be functionality to create and maintain a nutritional history for each patient spanning a longer period. Additionally, tools must be provided to analyze nutritional trends over time.

For the nutritional history, we created the interface of the files, which will be saved according to the nutritionist's record, which can be accessed in the bar at the top

These will be stored in the cloud and when you need to consult them you can do so. To facilitate this we have put a search section according to the patient's name.

## Cloud storage:
Description: The system must provide a secure and scalable cloud storage space for patient records, as well as ensure data synchronization between devices.

This requirement is essential and what makes our page different, it is present in the patient records database.
