# Summary of the evolution of user interfaces
In summary, the evolution of the user interfaces was that we implemented the software logo, we improved the nutritionist's registration method, implementing their professional ID as data, to give better security to patients, as well as we improved the patient's registration by adding data. more specific to the patient, we improved the records section, implying that it is a database in which all patient information is stored through the cloud, adding a method to find a specific patient, we improved the appearance and They are no longer as basic as those at the beginning.
