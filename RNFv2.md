<h1 id="non-functional-requirements">Non-Functional Requirements</h1>
<ol>
<li>Efficiency.<br>
The SW must be fast and work with few system requirements for easy access. Being such a specific software focuses on nutritionists allows us to have a reduced number of features.</li>
<li>Usability .<br>
It must be intuitive and easy to use so it will have a simple but complete interface. For that, we will arrange the features in the header so that they can be visible and easily accessible to the user. We are trying to improve a software used by these professionals, so we have the advantage that they have notions of how to use a software of this type.</li>
<li>Portability .<br>
It must work on different platforms so we will use the web format to provide access to the patientâ€™s info from any device at any time.</li>
</ol>
