<p>From our team’s perspective, if we identify that some of the values of the Agile Manifesto could pose challenges in our project, specifically five, it is crucial to address them efficiently to optimize our performance. Here’s how we can work on these aspects:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Excessive Documentation:</strong> We commit to simplifying and optimizing documentation. Let’s ensure it is accessible and easily understandable for all team members, considering the viewpoint of someone new joining the team. By maintaining only essential information, we avoid overloading ourselves with unnecessary documentation and promote a clear understanding of our processes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Rigid Planning:</strong> We acknowledge the importance of being flexible and adaptable. We commit to reviewing and adjusting our plan according to the changing needs of the project. Agility in our actions is fundamental to addressing unforeseen situations and taking advantage of new opportunities that may arise during development, particularly in deciding the functionalities of the page, such as creating a menu or focusing purely on medical data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Contractual Focus:</strong> We will strengthen our collaboration with the client (in this case, the instructor). We commit to establishing more frequent communication, showcasing regular progress, and product demonstrations. Let’s ensure our interactions with the client are continuous and smooth, allowing constant adaptation to their requirements and ensuring long-term satisfaction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Excessive Emphasis on Processes and Tools:</strong> We will simplify our processes and tools. We commit to focusing on direct collaboration and delivering functional software (hypothetically, as no team member has programming knowledge). By prioritizing interaction among ourselves, we aim to optimize efficiency and ensure an agile response to project challenges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lack of Emphasis on People and Interactions:</strong> We will place special emphasis on fostering effective communication within the team. We commit to facilitating face-to-face collaboration whenever possible, even though most team members work remotely. This initiative aims to build a trusting and transparent environment, enhancing our team cohesion.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, as a team, we commit to embracing these adjustments derived from the manifesto to ensure that agile values are effectively integrated into our project. This approach will allow us to develop high-quality software while maintaining our agility and adaptability to any changes in the project landscape.</p>
