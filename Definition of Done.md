<h2 id="definition-of-done">Definition of Done</h2>
<p>The “Definition of Done” (DoD) describes the quality standards for the Increment to be considered “done” and in a state that it can be effectively inspected. It provides to the Scrum Team and organization a common understanding of the completeness of the Increment. Without this crystal clarity, it’s not possible for stakeholders to provide informed and reliable feedback.</p>
<p>For our project we decided to prepare a list made up of several checkpoints in which it would be necessary to review each part that was considered finished.</p>
