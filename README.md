# PD-2-3. Development Phases and Life Cycle Models
**Using valid references (include them as part of the documentation) perform the following reflections. It is important that the arguments you present are based on the references used. Each reflection must have references.**
## Summary
Summary made in canva about the reflection related to the requirements phase and software engineering life cycle models. [Here.](https://www.canva.com/design/DAF0YEvBj5A/AordsDvjgOgcixGUevNi8Q/edit?utm_content=DAF0YEvBj5A&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton)
## Unit 2

 - Reflect on 3 technical skills associated with the Requirements phase. Indicates its importance within the Requirements Engineering cycle. Include arguments of your selection. Provides an example based on the experience of the team project they are developing. [Here.](https://github.com/Giuseph-CT/FIS-Proyecto-2023/blob/PD-2-3/Habilities%20on%20Requiriments.md)
 
 - It clearly explains the difference between Use Case Specification vs. User Stories. Additionally, it indicates in which cases the use of each of these tools is recommended. Provide an example based on the experience of the team project you are developing. [Here.](https://github.com/Giuseph-CT/FIS-Proyecto-2023/blob/PD-2-3/Use%20Cases%20and%20User%20Stories.md)

 - Select a product resulting from the design stage (Architecture, Database, User Interface). User, Procedures). Explains in a clear and synthetic way any method associated with the product resulting. Provide an example based on the team project experience they are developing. [Here. ](https://github.com/Giuseph-CT/FIS-Proyecto-2023/blob/PD-2-3/Use%20Cases%20and%20User%20Stories.md)

 - Research a method or technique that allows evidence to be included effectively in the testing process. development. From what stage can the tests be considered? Provide an example based on the experience of the team project they are developing and Using reliable sources, establish the minimum skills/knowledge/competencies essential elements that a Software Engineer must include in their academic training for the development of Secure Software Applications.( The two points are in a single branch)[Here. ](https://github.com/Giuseph-CT/FIS-Proyecto-2023/blob/PD-2-3/Software%20Development%20Testing.md)

## Unit 3

 - Assuming that the values ​​​​described in the "Manifesto for Agile Development" agreement software", cause conflict in the development process, reflect and describe clearly possible solutions using the project they are developing as a team as a basis. [Here. ](https://github.com/Giuseph-CT/FIS-Proyecto-2023/blob/PD-2-3/Agile%20Manifesto.md)
 - From the agile methodologies (Scrum, XP, Kanban, Design sprint, etc.), select two of them and identifies at least three of the software agility principles present in these methodologies. Also explain how these agility principles can be integrated into your development project. team, assuming it follows an agile methodology. [Here. ](https://github.com/Giuseph-CT/FIS-Proyecto-2023/blob/PD-2-3/Agile%20Methodologies.md)
