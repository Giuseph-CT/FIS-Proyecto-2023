# Unit 4- Reflections. Deadline (December 3)
With respect to the project you are carrying out, make an estimate that covers the effort required, the associated costs (including the allocation of salaries according to the functions and experience of each team member, indicate the reference used to calculate the salaries ) and the time necessary. To do this, use the function point technique based on the COSMIC method and apply it to a sprint of your choice.[Here.](https://github.com/Giuseph-CT/FIS-Proyecto-2023/blob/PD-4/Estimation%20by%20cosmic%20method.md)

Apply the WBS for user stories or use cases in a sprint of your choice and consider that the work packages contain: idWBS, name, duration, estimated cost. [Here.](https://github.com/Giuseph-CT/FIS-Proyecto-2023/blob/PD-4/Work%20Breakdown%20Structure%20%28WBS%29.md)

Presents a Gantt chart of the planning and scheduling of the
activities carried out in a sprint of your choice (consider milestones, start and end date for the activities, as well as those responsible of each activity) [Here.](https://github.com/Giuseph-CT/FIS-Proyecto-2023/blob/PD-4/diagram%20evidence.md)

Compare the quality models proposed by McCall and Boehm, identify and list their essential characteristics and reflect on which of these two models would be more appropriate to apply in your software development project. Justify your choice. [Here. ](https://github.com/Giuseph-CT/FIS-Proyecto-2023/blob/PD-4/Comparison%20of%20Quality%20Models:%20McCall%20vs.%20Boehm.md)

Choose two artifacts that were generated as part of your project process and perform an audit of the software configuration management, indicating whether they were configured and versioned. Below is a detailed report on the matter.
Note: the objective is for them to carry out the audit activity through checklist-type questions, in which they see the importance of configuration management.[Here.](https://github.com/Giuseph-CT/FIS-Proyecto-2023/blob/PD-4/Software%20Configuration%20Management%20Audit%20Report.md)
