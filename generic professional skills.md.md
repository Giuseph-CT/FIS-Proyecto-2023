<p><em><strong>GENERIC PROFESSIONAL SKILLS</strong></em></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Teamwork</strong><br>
Throughout our software development process, teamwork is the contribution of all team members, providing activities so that collectively we achieve the established objective. In our case, we apply this by holding meetings at the beginning of each sprint, establishing the activities each person will be responsible for. We also discuss the value of each activity, and ultimately, all team members must agree.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Adaptability to Changes and Errors</strong><br>
As the project progresses, there are always unexpected errors or changes. Team members must be capable of seeking creative solutions to rectify errors as quickly as possible. For this purpose, emergency meetings are also held to address significant errors promptly and collectively find resolutions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Clear and Effective Communication</strong><br>
Clear communication is fundamental in any project. Each team member should have an open mindset to accept criticism and suggestions. This will be achieved by maintaining a healthy environment without criticism, enabling individuals to express their opinions, problems, or solutions freely (as long as they are related to the project).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Time Organization</strong></p>

</ol>
<p>Time is a crucial element in any work environment. Therefore, time organization is conducted through meetings to establish schedules with their respective tasks and monitor progress to ensure timely delivery.</p>
