<td>When we created the repository, we had created folders and files that were not needed and uploaded them where they shouldn’t have been. As a result, there was a mix of unnecessary files that got tangled with the important ones, making it very difficult for us to upload things to the branch. Therefore, we decided to reorganize the repository and delete branches that were not serving any purpose, simultaneously giving it a better aesthetic."</td>
