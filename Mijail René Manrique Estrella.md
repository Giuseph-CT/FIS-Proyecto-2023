<h1 id="perfil">Perfil</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm Mijail Manrique, a young passionate student of Software Engineering at the Faculty of Mathematics at the Autonomous University of Yucatan.
During the last year, I have had the opportunity to work in the exciting world of bartending and customer service, which has allowed me to develop fundamental skills such as effective communication, empathy and the ability to work under pressure. This work experience has taught me the importance of attention to detail and delivering exceptional service.
One of my greatest strengths is my ability to learn quickly. I am always eager to acquire new knowledge and challenge my limits, which has led me to excel in my studies and keep up with the latest trends in technology and software development.
I am an attentive listener and committed to following instructions accurately. I believe that effective communication is the key to success in any project, and I am always willing to listen and learn from others.</p>
