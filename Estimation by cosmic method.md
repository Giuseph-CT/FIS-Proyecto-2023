<p>For this activity we decided to use the sprint we dedicated to the creation of the metric of evaluation and the percentage distribution in deliverable three as it is the closest to the current date.</p>
<p>Efford required</p>
<p>Effort Required = Size (number of CFPs) x Delivery Rate (hours per CFP)</p>
<p>2 Size (number of CFPs) x 3 Delivery Rate (hours per CFP) Effort Required =6 efford hours required</p>
<p>Associated costs</p>
<p>Cost of a software project = Size of the software x Cost per function point x Cost per function point.</p>
<p>Cost of a software project = Size of the software 2 Cost per function point 860.64USD$ x Cost per function points. =1721.74USD$</p>
<p>Timerequired</p>
<p>Project duration = COSMIC function points / COSMIC function points month Project duration = X months</p>
<p>Project duration = 2 COSMIC function points / 7 COSMIC function points month Sprint duration = 0.28 months</p>
