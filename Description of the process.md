<p>Description of the process.<p>
Our approach to the realization of this project began with the creation of a repository on GitHub as a central point of collaboration. Each team member established their own branch of work, which allowed for efficient management of individual contributions. To ensure an equitable distribution of tasks and accurate execution, we assigned specific roles to each team member. Mijail and Cristian were in charge of describing and managing the entire process. Adrián and Amir focused on defining the functional and non-functional requirements of the project. Benjamin was responsible for the creation and management of the required artifacts. Giuseph took responsibility for product description, user/customer identification and value proposition. Each time a team member completed their assigned task, it went through a verification process led by the project manager, Giuseph, and followed by the rest of the team. Once the quality and appropriateness of the contribution was confirmed, it was incorporated into the shared repository. Finally, once all the elements were ready, we proceeded with the preparation of the formal presentation and the creation of the video to meet the requirements of the activity. This structured and collaborative approach allowed us to effectively manage our project, ensuring quality and consistency at all stages of development.</p>
