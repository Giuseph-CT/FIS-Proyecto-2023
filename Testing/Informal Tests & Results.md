<h2 id="informal-tests">Informal Tests</h2>
<p>For the informal tests we used our <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/pRXoSTc9hG31a4m9xqo8YU/FIGMA?type=design&amp;node-id=3:1249&amp;mode=design&amp;t=agzO8RGZD2MHfqil-1">Figma interfaces</a> to see how difficult it is to use NutriNube for nutritionists and how fast they can find the different features of the website. For that we’ll ask they to simulate the register procces and go to the calories calculator following the next steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Register.</li>
<li>Login.</li>
<li>Create a new record</li>
<li>Go to calories calculator</li>
<li>Look for expedients.</li>
<li>Create a new patient record.</li>
<li>Sign Out</li>
</ol>
<p>This test is made for the people can do it with one click in every step. So, during that we’re going to take notes about the difficulties or facilities they had to find the features and qualify in a range from 1-3 depending of the clicks they do looking for the different sections of the webpage.<br>
(1) Done Easily<br>
(2) Done not so easily<br>
(3) Can’t do it</p>
<p>We asked to users their ages to see if that affects the performace doing this test depending of their ages. We reserved the names for confidentiality issues.<br>
Also we’re going to take notes about difficulties about the parameters that we didn’t consider for making improvements on NutriNube.</p>

</table><h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>Higher totals means a ban performance doing this test. The vertical sums indicate the performance of each user and the horizontal sums indicate which features users had the most problems with in general. So we can make some conclutions based on the previus results.<br>
Users 2 and 3 had the worst performance, they had difficulties to translate the name of the features because they don’t speak English so they didn’t undestand so well.<br>
On the other hand users 1, 4 and 5 did it perfectly and coincidentally they are younger people and have more notion in english language.<br>
We also know our test users had problems looking for expedients and creating a patient record.</p>
