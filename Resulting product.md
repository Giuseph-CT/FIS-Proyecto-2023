<p><strong>Resulting product</strong><br>
Select a product resulting from the design stage (Architecture, Database, User Interface, Procedures). Explains in a clear and synthetic way any method associated with the resulting product. Provide an example based on the experience of the team project you are developing.</p>
<p>Selected resulting product: User interface.</p>
<p>A method associated with the resulting product of the user interface could be “Usability Testing”. Usability testing is a process by which the user interface is evaluated with real users to identify potential design issues and improve the overall user experience.</p>
<p>This method has a process which consists of 7 stages:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Definition of Objectives: Before carrying out the test, it is crucial to establish the objectives that you want to achieve. This could include identifying navigation problems, understanding the user’s efficiency in performing specific tasks, and evaluating overall user satisfaction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Selection of Representative Users: Participants who represent the target audience of the product are chosen. These users should be people who are likely to use the system in real life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creation of Usage Scenarios: Realistic usage scenarios are prepared to guide participants through various functions of the interface. These scenarios should reflect common situations that users would face.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data Collection: During the test, data is collected by observing user behavior, asking questions, and recording their comments. Screen recording tools and eye tracking software can also be used to obtain additional information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Analysis of Results: The data collected is analyzed to identify patterns, trends and specific problems. This may include areas of confusion, task completion times, and general user opinions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Design Iteration: Based on the results of the usability test, adjustments are made to the user interface to address identified issues. This process may involve changes in the visual design, the arrangement of elements, navigation, among others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Iteration Testing: The usability testing cycle can be repeated several times during product development to ensure that the improvements made have had the desired impact and to identify any new problems that may arise.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Example based on experience:</strong><br>
In my case, I made the sketches of the user interfaces, in my experience I carried out this method of usability testing halfway so to speak, since I marked the objectives that the interfaces had to have based on the functional and non-functional requirements , I had to make sure that it met these requirements, on the other hand, I asked several people what they thought about the appearance and whether it was easy and quick to understand, this helped me give an idea in which I could realize what aspect to improve the interfaces and to be able to improve them with respect to the opinions of the different people I asked, and I repeated this same process about three times until I was satisfied with the sketch of interfaces and achieved the objectives of meeting said requirements and making them pleasant , easy and quick to understand for the client.</p>
