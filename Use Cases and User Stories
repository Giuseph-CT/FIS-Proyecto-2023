<h2 id="use-cases-and-user-stories">Use Cases and User Stories</h2>
<p>Within Software Engineering, the specification of use cases, as defined by Alistair Cockburn in his book “Writing Effective Use Cases” published in 2001, is described as a technique used to capture and describe interactions between a system and its actors. These actors can be users, other systems, or external components, with the intention of documenting the functional requirements of a system from the user’s perspective.</p>
<p>Additionally, Cockburn suggests the use of narrative descriptions to document use cases. This is considered a crucial point as it allows for a more thorough and detailed understanding of the system’s behavior in different situations. The use of diagrams is also proposed, facilitating the visualization of relationships and links between various use cases and actors.</p>
<p>Now, user stories, as defined by Mike Cohn in his book “User Stories Applied: For Agile Software Development,” are a specific technique within agile development used to express requirements in a clear and user-focused manner. Cohn defines a user story as a brief description of desired system functionality from the end user’s perspective. These stories are written in a simple and understandable format, aiming to encourage communication and collaboration between developers and project stakeholders.</p>
<p>While both can be used to document the desired behavior of the software by capturing requirements, there are certain key points that differentiate them:</p>
<p>Generally, use cases tend to be more detailed and extensive, including information about the involved actors, detailed interactions between the system and users, and are commonly represented through diagrams. On the other hand, user stories are brief, exclusively focused on the user, and written in a less formal format for user understanding. They usually do not provide many details and concentrate on the desired functionality from the user’s perspective.</p>
<p>Another point to highlight is their scope, as use cases can address larger and more complex functionalities involving multiple steps and components, whereas user stories are typically smaller and more specific, often representing a single functionality or feature that adds value to the user.</p>
<p>Among the different scenarios where use cases can be utilized are:</p>
<ul>
<li>For large projects; according to literature, they are deemed suitable for large and complex projects where a detailed and exhaustive specification of requirements is required. According to Alistair Cockburn in “Writing Effective Use Cases,” it is recommended to use use cases in complex projects to effectively capture and communicate requirements.</li>
<li>For in-depth analysis; according to Kurt Bittner and Ian Spence in “Use Case Modeling,” they recommend and detail the application of use cases in modeling to understand complex systems, especially when there are multiple interactions between actors and the system, as use cases provide a more comprehensive view.</li>
</ul>
<p>Among the cases where the use of user stories is recommended are:</p>
<ul>
<li>For agile development; user stories are appropriate in agile environments where flexibility and responsiveness to constant changes in requirements are prioritized.</li>
<li>For small projects; projects seeking a lighter approach and agile requirements management, as proposed by Mike Cohn in “Agile Estimating and Planning,” where agile estimation and planning strategies often align with the use of user stories.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example based on the team’s project:</p>
<p>Use Case: Accessing nutritional data from the cloud</p>
<p>Actors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nutritionist (Primary User)</li>
<li>Cloud Storage</li>
</ul>
<p>Objective:<br>
The nutritionist should be able to securely and efficiently access and retrieve patients’ nutritional data stored in the cloud.</p>
<p>Main Flow of Events:</p>
<ol>
<li>The nutritionist logs into the nutritional calculation software in the cloud.</li>
<li>Selects the “Access cloud data” option from the main menu.</li>
<li>The system requests authentication from the nutritionist to ensure security.</li>
<li>Once authenticated, the nutritionist can browse and search for patient profiles stored in the cloud.</li>
<li>Selects a specific patient to view their nutritional history stored in the cloud.</li>
</ol>
<p>Alternative Event Flows:</p>
<ol>
<li>If authentication fails, the system notifies the nutritionist and does not allow access to cloud data.</li>
<li>If there is no stored data for the selected patient, the system informs the nutritionist that no information is available.</li>
</ol>
<p>Preconditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The nutritionist has access to an internet connection.</li>
<li>The nutritional calculation software is functioning correctly.</li>
</ul>
<p>Postconditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The nutritionist can view and retrieve the nutritional data of the selected patient stored in the cloud from any internet-connected device.</li>
</ul>
<p>This use case reflects an essential operation for cloud-based nutritional calculation software, where patient information is stored centrally and securely. It enables the professional to access and retrieve nutritional data efficiently, leveraging the capabilities of cloud storage for patient information management. Additionally, a diagram representing the software’s usage behavior with the user was added to the project.</p>
