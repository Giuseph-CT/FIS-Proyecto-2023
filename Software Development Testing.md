<h2 id="software-development-testing">Software Development Testing</h2>
<p>In the realm of software development, there exist numerous techniques and methods that aid in effectively conducting tests throughout the development process. It is imperative to distinguish between manual and automated testing methods in software development.</p>
<p><strong>Manual Testing</strong></p>
<p>Manual testing involves direct human interaction with the application or software. This method can be costly and susceptible to human errors due to manual setup and the possibility of omissions during the testing process.</p>
<p><strong>Automated Testing</strong></p>
<p>In contrast, automated testing is executed by predefined scripts run by a machine. These tests can range from verifying specific functions to simulating complex sequences of actions within the software interface.</p>
<p>Each method has its advantages and disadvantages; automated tests are quicker and more feasible, although ensuring well-written test scripts is essential.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-tests">Types of Tests</h2>
<p>There are numerous types of tests:</p>
<p><strong>1) Unit Testing:</strong> These are low-level tests that validate specific methods or functions within the software. They execute near the application’s source and are cost-effective to automate, enabling rapid execution through a continuous integration server.</p>
<p><strong>2) Integration Testing:</strong> Integration tests involve combining different components such as interaction with the database or coordination among microservices. However, these tests are more costly as they require multiple parts of the application to be initiated to ensure seamless operation when brought together.</p>
<p><strong>3) Performance Testing:</strong> Performance tests essentially establish the parameters under which the application is expected to operate. They help measure the reliability, speed, scalability, and responsiveness of the application. For instance, measuring response times when executing a large number of requests, as well as identifying traffic peaks.</p>
<p>These are some of the many test types, and personally, these are the three most crucial ones.</p>
<h2 id="exploratory-testing">Exploratory Testing</h2>
<p>As more features and enhancements are introduced into your code, subjecting it to tests becomes increasingly important to ensure the entire system functions properly. It’s vital to verify that resolved errors do not reoccur in future software versions. Automation plays a crucial role in this task, and writing tests before or after becomes a habitual routine in your development process.</p>
<h2 id="at-what-stage-can-testing-be-considered">At What Stage Can Testing be Considered?</h2>
<p>Software testing dates back to the early days of software development. Tom Kilburn, a computer scientist, is credited with writing the first piece of software, which debuted on June 21, 1948.</p>
<p>Traditionally, software testing has been segregated from the rest of the development process, often conducted later in the software development life cycle after the product’s creation or execution stage.</p>
<p>Many development teams now embrace a methodology known as continuous testing. It’s part of a DevOps approach, where development and operations collaborate throughout the product’s lifecycle.</p>
<p><em><strong>EXPERIENCE</strong></em></p>
<p>Personally, I believe that initiating tests from the outset is beneficial. However, it might be worthwhile to establish specific checkpoints at which to conduct respective tests. This is the approach we would implement in our software.</p>
<p><strong>Outline the Minimum Skills/Knowledge/Competencies a Software Engineer Should Include in Their Academic Training</strong></p>
<p><strong>1)</strong> Ability to resolve integration problems based on available strategies, standards, and technologies.</p>
<p><strong>2)</strong> Capability to identify, assess, and manage potential associated risks.</p>
<p><strong>3)</strong> Ability to formally analyze and rigorously reason about the correctness and properties of built systems.</p>
<p><strong>4)</strong> Capability to navigate a work environment by understanding the functioning and organization of a company. Also, applying acquired knowledge within a business context involving some of the specific technologies developed in the curriculum.</p>
