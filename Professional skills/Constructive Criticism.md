<h1 id="constructive-criticism">CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM</h1>
<p>To be honest, of all the subjects we had, this one stood out the most for us because at the beginning we thought it would be the typical subject where a teacher explains the topic, conducts exams, assigns a project at the end, and that’s it. However, the way both Professor Cambranes and Professor Luis Basto conducted the entire semester seemed brilliant to me. The idea of inviting people already working abroad every Monday to personally share their experiences in the field they developed and where they are currently working seemed like a spectacular idea. Similarly, it allows us to realize whether what they are teaching us really applies when working abroad currently or not.</p>
<p>Also, the practical exercises they assigned seemed very good and appropriate because everything learned makes you reconsider whether it is useful or not for yourself. Overall, the classes were always very comprehensive. Initially, we thought the assignments would be research or individual activities, but I see doing everything in a team as much better and more optimal as it closely resembles reality. When you work, you’ll always be working with a team, and you’ll almost never work alone. What we think could contribute to the class is being stricter with punctuality because some people arrived 30 minutes or 1 hour late, interrupting the discussion. Another point we believe could be beneficial is that after each discussion, randomly or voluntarily selecting 3 or 4 students to explain everything they learned from that practice, around 30 seconds to 1 minute. This way, indirectly, everyone pays much more attention to the discussions and doesn’t just spend time on their phones or doing assignments for other subjects.</p>
<p>Overall, it seemed like a very entertaining and interesting subject and semester, despite our team not coordinating well together and facing many problems.</p>
