<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>User Authentication (Login):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Implement a secure login system requiring unique credentials for access. This ensures the privacy and security of patient information.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Patient Registration:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The system must allow nutrition professionals to register patients, including personal, medical, and nutritional information. Additionally, the importation of patient data from electronic health record (EHR) systems should be permitted to simplify the process.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Calculation of Nutritional Requirements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The software must be capable of accurately calculating personalized nutritional requirements for each patient, taking into account their age, medical conditions, and changes in health status over time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Nutritional History:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There should be functionality to create and maintain a nutritional history for each patient that spans a longer period. Furthermore, tools should be provided to analyze nutritional trends over time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cloud Storage:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The system must provide a secure and scalable cloud storage space for patient records, in addition to ensuring data synchronization between devices.</li>

<p>The first requirement, focusing on patient registration, ensures that nutrition professionals can seamlessly record crucial personal, medical, and nutritional information. The additional capability to import data from Electronic Health Records (EHR) is a key feature that enhances efficiency. This requirement sufficiently addresses the foundational aspect of managing patient information comprehensively.</p>
<p>The second requirement emphasizes the software’s capability to perform precise calculations of personalized nutritional requirements for each patient. This feature takes into account dynamic factors such as age, medical conditions, and changes in health status over time. The specificity of this requirement is deemed adequate to meet the diverse nutritional needs of individual patients.</p>
<p>The third requirement introduces a crucial functionality for creating and maintaining a longitudinal nutritional history for each patient. This extended historical perspective is essential for healthcare professionals to analyze and understand trends in patients’ nutritional well-being over a more extended period. The tools provided for trend analysis enhance the system’s capability for informed decision-making.</p>
<p>The fourth requirement focuses on the technical infrastructure, ensuring a secure and scalable cloud storage solution for patient records. Additionally, the imperative for data synchronization between devices is vital for seamless access to patient information across different platforms. This requirement lays a robust foundation for a modern, accessible, and secure data management system.</p>
<p>In essence, the decision not to alter the existing requirements is a strategic choice rooted in a thorough understanding of project dynamics, stakeholder needs, and a commitment to efficient and predictable development. This approach ensures that the project remains on track, delivering a robust nutrition system that fulfills user expectations and industry standards.</p>
