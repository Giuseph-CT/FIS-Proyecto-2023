<h2 id="informal-tests">Informal Tests</h2>
<p>For the informal tests we used our <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/pRXoSTc9hG31a4m9xqo8YU/FIGMA?type=design&amp;node-id=3:1249&amp;mode=design&amp;t=agzO8RGZD2MHfqil-1">Figma interfaces</a> to see how difficult it is to use NutriNube for nutritionists and how fast they can find the different features of the website. For that we’ll ask they to simulate the register procces and go to the calories calculator following the next steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Register.</li>
<li>Login.</li>
<li>Create a new record</li>
<li>Save the file on cloud.</li>
<li>Look for expedients and patients record.</li>
<li>Sign Out</li>
</ol>
<p>This test is made for the people can do it with 1 click in every step. So, during that we’re going to take notes about the difficulties or facilities they had to find the features and qualify in a range from 1-3 depending of the clicks they do looking for the different sections of the webpage.</p>
